# Select - Open

This is a tiny Chrome extension that allows to open Jira tickets from a page where only the ID of the ticket is given without a proper link.

This prototype is currently hard coded to process only two Jira projects named CAMP and NEO.

When a selection in the current page contains a Jira of the form CAMP-1234 or NEO-789 it adds a clickable tooltip that will open the matching Jira page.

Awesome.
