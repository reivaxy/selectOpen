# Select - Open

This is a tiny Chrome extension that allows to open Jira tickets from a page (let's say a Slack chat for instance) where only the ID of the ticket was given, without a proper link. For people whose co-workers can't just copy/paste a link but rather copy paste Jira ID's to FORCE you to copy paste it either in the Jira search box or the url of an already opened ticket. I just whish they stopped. But sometimes I do it too.

This prototype is currently hard coded to open on a hard coded Jira instance.

When a selection in the current page contains a Jira of the form ABCDE-1234 it adds a clickable tooltip that will open the matching Jira page.

Awesome.
